# A typical camera ID does not usually exceed 16 characters and ID’s may vary in length depending on the manufacturer, so we use VARCHAR
# The ID should not be null. Otherwise, we cannot identify the camera
timestamp DATETIME,
              # The oldest camera footage recorded was 1888
              # The company may wish to reuse or modify this table after 2035

# Paths are generally smaller than 255 characters at max
# We may “never search more than a certain number of leading characters in a field” in a file path
# We may only need the text after the last ‘/’ when searching
# Therefore, TINYTEXT should be used instead of VARCHAR
# Every entry must have a camera (ID) and a video (PATH), so it cannot be null

# For thumbnail, the same logic as video_content applies
# thumbnail and hash can be optional fields as they can be calculated later
